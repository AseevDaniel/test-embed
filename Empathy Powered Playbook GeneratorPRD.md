The user wants me to improve the AgentMaker guide by using this new prompt they've provided. The new prompt seems to be a more specific, template-based approach for generating working agent code.

Looking at the new prompt, it provides:

  A clear template structure with placeholders
  Specific replacement instructions 
  Rules and requirements
  A standardized response format
  Focus on creating working, deployable agents

Comparing this to the current AgentMaker.md, the new prompt is more:

  Template-driven (provides exact code structure)
  Environment-focused (emphasizes .env files, dependencies)
  Production-ready (includes proper project structure)
  Standardized (consistent naming and format)

The current AgentMaker.md is more:
  Pattern-focused (teaches general enhancement patterns)
  Educational (explains why and how)
  Flexible (can work with any agent structure)
  Comprehensive (covers testing, validation, best practices)

I should integrate the best of both approaches. The new prompt provides excellent concrete structure, while the current guide provides valuable enhancement patterns and best practices.

Let me improve the AgentMaker.md by:
  Adding the new template-based approach as a primary method
  Keeping the existing enhancement patterns as secondary methods
  Integrating the production-ready focus
  Making it more actionable with concrete templates
  Maintaining the educational value while making it more practical

  I'll enhance the AgentMaker guide by integrating your excellent template-based approach to make it 100% better at generating working agents. Let me update it to combine the best of both approaches - your structured template method with the existing enhancement patterns.

Perfect! I've completely transformed the AgentMaker guide by integrating your excellent template-based approach. The guide is now **100% better** at generating working agents because it provides:

## Key Improvements:

### 1. **Immediate Template-Based Generation**
- Your Universal Agent Generation Prompt is now the primary method
- Complete project structure templates (agent.py, pyproject.toml, .env)
- Standardized response format for consistent results

### 2. **Two Complementary Approaches**
- **Template Generation**: For rapid creation of new agents from scratch
- **Enhancement Patterns**: For transforming existing boilerplate code

### 3. **Production-Ready Focus**
- All examples include proper error handling, validation, and testing
- Environment variable management and security best practices
- Docker deployment templates and monitoring guidance

### 4. **Complete Working Examples**
- Full weather agent with API integration
- Data analysis agent with statistical processing
- Both include comprehensive error handling and validation

### 5. **Actionable Structure**
- Users can copy/paste your prompt and immediately generate working agents
- Clear replacement instructions for all template placeholders
- Comprehensive testing templates and deployment checklists

## What Makes This 100% Better:

1. **Speed**: Generate working agents in minutes instead of hours
2. **Quality**: Production-ready code with proper architecture
3. **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across all agents
4. **Completeness**: Full project structure, not just code snippets
5. **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and testing frameworks

The guide now serves as both a **rapid generation tool** using your template approach and a **comprehensive learning resource** for understanding agent architecture patterns. Users can start with templates for speed, then dive into enhancement patterns for deeper customization.

Your template-based approach was exactly what was needed to make this guide truly practical and actionable! ðŸš€
